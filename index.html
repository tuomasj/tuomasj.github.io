  <h2>Hi, I'm Tuomas ðŸ‘‹</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a technology enthustiast and a programmer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love working on problems that eventually look like products or services.
  </p>
  <p>
    My first computer was in fact Spectravideo 328 but I got Commodore 64 bit later. So technically, I was Spectravideo 328 kid first, but then I reinvented myself as Commodore 64 kid. It's bit weird, Commodore 64 had inferior programming tooling and programming manuals but it was still the most popular 8-bit computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, I have been writing code pretty much every day. Programming is fun, you should try it too! ðŸ™‚
