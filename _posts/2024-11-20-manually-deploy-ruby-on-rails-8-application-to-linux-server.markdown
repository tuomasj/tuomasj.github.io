  This is a draft
</div>

This article describes how you can manually deploy your Ruby on Rails 8 application on a Linux Server with as few dependencies as possible. It's all manual, there is no automations [Kamal](https://www.kamal-deploy-org), [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [Thruster](https://github.com/basecamp/thruster) in this way of deployment.

## Before continuing, here are few things you need to understand

- In this article, `example.com` will be used as a placeholder for your own domain or IP-address
- You have to configure the firewall
- You have to secure the SSH server
- You have a SSH public key on your own local development machine
- Configure DNS-records so that your domain's A-record resolves into server's IP-address
- This article assumes you are using Ubuntu Linux, these instructions will not work if you're using any other Linux distribution
- Please consider this article as **"some guy wrote in Internet"**-level information, use your own judgement and common sense
- You can host multiple Ruby on Rails applications in same server by using this method, but you have to understand that apps are deployed using same unix user `deploy` and therefore are able to write each other directories
- Finally the disclaimer: If you follow the instructions of this article, you will do it at your own risk -- I will take no responsibility at all

Now that I'm safe for any legal proceedings, let's continue ðŸ˜…

## The deployment consists of following building blocks

- **Firewall** - Allows at least HTTPS and HTTP requests, configuring firewall is out of scope of this article
- **Nginx** - Webserver which handles the requests from the browser, and routes the requests into Puma application server or directly serves static assets from assets directory
- **Puma** - Application server which runs your Ruby on Rails application
- **SQLite3** - Database server which is embedded into your Ruby on Rails application
- **Static assets** - Your Ruby on Rails application has `public/` directory, Nginx will serve these assets directly without using Puma
- **Let's Encrypt** - Generate SSL certificates so you can use HTTPS

## Creating the deploy user

In this step, you have to connect to your server as root user and create the `deploy` user.

```bash
adduser --disabled-password deploy
usermod -aG sudo deploy
```

Create a directory for your SSH files and your public key file.

```bash
mkdir -p /home/deploy/.ssh
chown -R deploy:deploy /home/deploy/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh
```

Append the contents of your SSH public key into `/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys`, most likely the file will be empty or you have to create it.

If you want to know more, head to SSH's website for details about [public-key authentication](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication).

## Setting up the server

First, let's try the public key authentication. Use SSH to connect your server:

```bash
$ ssh deploy@example.com
```

If you see Ubuntu Linux welcome message, you are good to go!

```
$ ssh deploy@example.com
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-122-generic aarch64)

 * Management:     https://landscape.canonical.com
 * Support:        https://ubuntu.com/pro

Last login: Thu Nov 21 15:25:13 2024 from 12.34.56.78
deploy@example.com:~$
```

After that install the following packages:

```shell
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y curl git-core nginx nodejs npm yarn ruby-full build-essential libsqlite3-dev
```

This will install Git, Nginx, NodeJS, Yarn, Npm, development libraries and SQLite3.

## Hosting website via Nginx

To find out if Nginx is already running on your server, use combination of commands `ps` and `grep` like this `ps aux | grep nginx`. If it is running, the output looks like this:

```bash
$ ps aux | grep nginx
root       59329  0.0  0.0  65920  2436 ?        Ss   Nov17   0:00 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;
www-data   59330  0.0  0.2  67016 11432 ?        S    Nov17   0:15 nginx: worker process
www-data   59331  0.0  0.2  66908 11056 ?        S    Nov17   0:00 nginx: worker process
```

If the Nginx is running, then it should respond to your browser when you use `http://example.com`.

## Securing the connection with Let's Encrypt

<div  style="border: 1px solid #bf9d5a; background-color: #eddbb8; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.45rem;">
  Please note, you need a server with public IP-address and a domain name pointing to that IP-adddress in order to continue.

## Running you Ruby on Rails application with Puma

### Installing Ruby for your deploy user

Your need Ruby to run your Ruby on Rails application, and you need to run Ruby as `deploy`-user. In order to have total control for your Ruby installation, you need to install it via Ruby package managers.

So first, let's install `rbenv`, a Ruby version manager.

Follow [the installation instructions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-git-checkout) on rbenv homepage and come back to this article once you have Ruby running. Remember to install Ruby into your `deploy` user.

You can check if Ruby was installed correctly by running `which ruby`, the output should be:

```bash
bob@example:~$ which ruby
/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims/ruby
```

### Directory structure on your production server

Our application will live in `/var/www/apps/`. The `/var` directory contains things that will be changed over the time, such as log-files, web-sites, databases. It's a good place for web applications as well.

The directory structure for Ruby on Rails application deployment looks like this:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ apps
    â””â”€â”€ masterlist
        â”œâ”€â”€ current -> var/www/apps/masterlist/releases/2024-11-22-13-30
        â”œâ”€â”€ logs
        â”œâ”€â”€ releases
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-11-21-07-45
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-11-21-09-11
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 2024-11-22-13-30
        â”œâ”€â”€ shared
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ storage
        â””â”€â”€ tmp
            â”œâ”€â”€ pids
            â””â”€â”€ sockets
```

- **current** - This is a symbolic link to your latest deployment version of your application, in this case `current` points to `releases/2024-11-22-13-30` directory.
- **logs** - Puma will write two log files, accesses and errors, and both files are in this directory
- **releases** - This directory contains all deployed versions of your application, everytime you want to deploy a new version of you application, just create a directory and copy all files from your local development environment to here
- **shared** - All files that will not change between deployments are stored here, the database of your application is placed here so it won't be erased in every deployment
- **tmp** - Temporary files, there are files related to the Puma processes, and cache files

The `releases/`-directory is the core of the deployment process. Each deployment gets own directory and the `current/`-directory contains the files of newest deployment because it is always symlinked to the latest directory in `releases/`.

### First deployment

Let's do everything manually for the first deployment. Once everything is working, then sprinkle some automation via bash script.

Create all the required directories mentioned earlier. In this example, the application is called `masterlist`, change it to match your own application. Also make sure that the directories are owned by the `deploy`-user account.

```bash
$ cd /var/www
$ sudo mkdir -p apps/masterlist
$ sudo mkdir -p apps/masterlist/logs
$ sudo mkdir -p apps/masterlist/tmp/pids
$ sudo mkdir -p apps/masterlist/tmp/sockets
$ sudo mkdir -p apps/masterlist/tmp/shared/storage
$ sudo mkdir -p apps/masterlist/releases
$ sudo chown -R deploy:deploy masterlist # make sure the `deploy`-user owns the directories
```

#### Timestamping the deployment (a.k.a. release) and copying files for local development environment

There is a unix command called `date` which we can use to generate the timestamp of current time.

```
$ date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"
2024-11-22-14-44-59
```

The format is `year-month-day-hours-minutes-seconds` and it gives your pretty good guarantee that each deployment will have an unique directory.

With the new timestamp, let's create a directory inside the `releases/`-directory.

```bash
$ cd /var/www/apps/masterlist
$ mkdir releases/2024-11-22-14-44-59
```

Copy the files from local development environment to production server. Use `scp` which is a part of SSH toolkit. In your local development environment, switch to the directory of the application and run following command.

```bash
# this following command MUST be run on your local development environment (a.k.a. your own computer)
$ scp -R * deploy@example.com:/var/www/apps/masterlist/releases/2024-11-22-14-44-59
```

Now we can create the symbolic link (a.k.a. symlink). This will be run on the production server.

```bash
# make sure you are in /var/www/apps/masterlist directory
$ ln -sf releases/2024-11-22-14-44-59 current
```

Everything is ready for Puma to run your Ruby on Rails application from `current/`-directory and store the database in `shared/storage`.

You can test that everything works by running `rails console` in `current/`-directory. In production server, your application will run in production-mode, therefore we have to use `RAILS_ENV=production` everytime we run any rails commands.

```bash
$ cd current
$ RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails console
```



But before that, we need to setup the ruby on rails application.

### Setting up the application

Create the database by running the database migrations. Make sure you are running the migrations in production mode by prefixing the command with `RAILS_ENV=production`.

```bash
$ cd /var/www/apps/masterlist/current
$ RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails db:migrate
```

Then you have to compile all assets so they become static assets, to be served by Nginx.

```bash
$ RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails assets:precompile
```
Again, make sure you're in production environment by writing `RAILS_ENV=production` before `bin/rails assets:precompile`.
