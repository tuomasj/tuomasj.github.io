  This is a draft
</div>

This article describes how you can manually deploy your Ruby on Rails 8 application on a Linux Server with as few dependencies as possible. It's all manual, there is no automations [Kamal](https://www.kamal-deploy-org), [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [Thruster](https://github.com/basecamp/thruster) in this way of deployment.

## Before continuing, here are few things you need to understand

- In this article, `example.com` will be used as a placeholder for your own domain or IP-address
- You have to configure the firewall
- You have to secure the SSH server
- You have a SSH public key on your own local development machine
- Configure DNS-records so that your domain's A-record resolves into server's IP-address
- This article assumes you are using Ubuntu Linux, these instructions will not work if you're using any other Linux distribution
- Please consider this article as **"some guy wrote in Internet"**-level information, use your own judgement and common sense
- Finally the disclaimer: If you follow the instructions of this article, you will do it at your own risk -- I will take no responsibility at all

Now that I'm safe for any legal proceedings, let's continue ðŸ˜…

## The deployment consists of following building blocks

- **Firewall** - Allows at least HTTPS and HTTP requests, configuring firewall is out of scope of this article
- **Nginx** - Webserver which handles the requests from the browser, and routes the requests into Puma application server or directly serves static assets from assets folder
- **Puma** - Application server which runs your Ruby on Rails application
- **SQLite3** - Database server which is embedded into your Ruby on Rails application
- **Static assets** - Your Ruby on Rails application has `public/` folder, Nginx will serve these assets directly without using Puma
- **Let's Encrypt** - Generate SSL certificates so you can use HTTPS

## Creating the deploy user

In this step, you have to connect to your server as root user and create the `deploy` user.

```bash
adduser --disabled-password deploy
```

Create a folder for your SSH files and your public key file.

```bash
mkdir -p /home/deploy/.ssh
chown -R deploy:deploy /home/deploy/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/deploy/.ssh
```

Append the contents of your SSH public key into `/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys`, most likely the file will be empty or you have to create it.

If you want to know more, head to SSH's website for details about [public-key authentication](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication).

## Setting up the server

First, let's try the public key authentication. Use SSH to connect your server:

```bash
$ ssh deploy@example.com
```

If you see Ubuntu Linux welcome message, you are good to go!

```
$ ssh deploy@example.com
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-122-generic aarch64)

deploy@example.com:~$
```

After that install the following packages:

```shell
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y curl git-core nginx nodejs npm yarn ruby-full build-essential libsqlite3-dev
```

This will install Git, Nginx, NodeJS, Yarn, Npm, development libraries and SQLite3.

## Hosting website via Nginx

To find out if Nginx is already running on your server, use combination of commands `ps` and `grep` like this `ps aux | grep nginx`. If it is running, the output looks like this:

```bash
$ ps aux | grep nginx
root       59329  0.0  0.0  65920  2436 ?        Ss   Nov17   0:00 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;
www-data   59330  0.0  0.2  67016 11432 ?        S    Nov17   0:15 nginx: worker process
www-data   59331  0.0  0.2  66908 11056 ?        S    Nov17   0:00 nginx: worker process
```

If the Nginx is running, then it should respond to your browser when you use `http://example.com`.

## Securing the connection with Let's Encrypt

<div class="note">
  Please note, you need a server with public IP-address and a domain name pointing to that IP-adddress in order to continue.

## Running you Ruby on Rails application with Puma

### Installing Ruby for your deploy user

Your need Ruby to run your Ruby on Rails application, and you need to run Ruby as `deploy`-user. In order to have total control for your Ruby installation, you need to install it via Ruby package managers.

So first, let's install `rbenv`, a Ruby version manager.

Follow [the installation instructions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-git-checkout) on rbenv homepage and come back to this article once you have Ruby running. Remember to install Ruby into your `deploy` user.

You can check if Ruby was installed correctly by running `which ruby`, the output should be:

```bash
bob@example:~$ which ruby
/home/deploy/.rbenv/shims/ruby
```

### Folder structure on your server

### Unix process management with Systemd

## Storing data into SQLite3 database

## Serving static assets

## Automating the deployment
