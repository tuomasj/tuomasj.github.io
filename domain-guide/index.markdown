## Why should I own a domain?

Internet domain is like a piece of land, it's a piece of land in  Internet. The domain is your address in Internet. 

More importantly, it is outside of any "walled garden". 

## What are top-level domains?

When Internet was invented [back in the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet), there were only handful of top-level domains (TLD's), such as `.com`, `.org`, `.edu`, `.mil`.

If you want to build a business, try to get `.com` domain.

## Where to buy a domain?

## Getting your website online

## I want to send and receive emails on my own domain

## How do I know much visits my website gets?

Website Analytics or Web Analytics is the software you need. It means that you put a piece of code on every page on your website. Every time someone visits your website, that piece of code will ping back to the web analytics server and record a visit into a database. 

Many web analytics tools will also store an unique identifier in your browser. That unique identifier is used to track visitors across the internet. For example, Google Analytics is using that unique identifier to track people when they visit different websites across Internet. 

The more web analytics data is collected, it increases the accuracy of personalisation on ads that are displayed to you.

European Union has "cookie" regulation that tried to set limits on the data which is being collected on Internet users, but instead of collecting less data, website analytics tools started to ask permission to continue collect all the data they can. That's why websites in Europe have that annoying cookie banner.

But luckily you don't have to annoy your users with cookie banner if you use privacy-friendly web analytics.
